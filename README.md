# Simple-Rock-Paper-Scissor-iOS-app
This is the very first fundamental app I developed in Swift. I didn't really know much back then, so this was just to get familiar with the iOS SDK and swift.
Lets a user play a classic game of rock paper and scissors. The user can set the number of rounds from a range of 3 to 7. Makes use of UIStackViews, some UIAnimations based on constraints.
